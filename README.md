# COSC 320 Code

This repo has all of the code for Stan Warford's COSC 320 class, with most of the exercises completed. The entire course can be found at [https://cslab.pepperdine.edu/warford/cosc320/](https://cslab.pepperdine.edu/warford/cosc320/), all of which is available to use under a CC BY-SA license.

COSC 320, also known as Data Structures, is a course that has three learning objectives: C++, object oriented programming, and data structures.

## About This Repo

Every folder except `CoSc 320 Sort Paper Template` and `SortProject` is part of the `dp4dsDistribution` package, from a prepublication manuscript called *Design Patterns for Data Structures* (dp4ds) by Dung Nguyen and J. Stanley Warford. See the course website for more details. Essentially, this repo has all of the code from dp4ds with my solutions to the problems. Unfortunately, the graphs portion remains unfilled because there was an accident that shut down Pepperdine, causing our class to not have enough time to cover graphs.

`CoSc 320 Sort Paper Template` is the Overleaf project for a paper about sorting algorithms, which was one of the homework assignments. `SortProject` is the RStudio project for the sort paper.

## A Personal Note

I do not really care to make this repo able to be downloaded and executed. This is a memory of what was, a record that I did the class. Is my code flawless? Absolutely not. Will I fix it? Also absolutely not. It's *my* code, *my* work (except the parts that aren't, in which I give credit to whoever wrote the code), *my* barely tested abhorrent abomination.

The sort paper might just be the single most scuffed piece of literature I have ever written and handed in for an official assignment, but I do not care. It's *my* scuffed paper, a product of *my* hard work and a *lot* of caffeine.

Thank you, Dr. Warford.
